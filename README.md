# ResizableDiscordVideo
Makes the Discord mini player/video (Picture-in-Picture) window for video calls resizable.
Ever wanted to watch someones screen bigger than the default PiP window size, but still be able to type/use Discord?
I could not find a plugin that solves this issue so, so I made this really quickly, hope this is useful to someone, as it was to me!
(probably very buggy)
